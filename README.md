# 🌱 NovaSTEM & NovaSTEM EDU

**Hands-on STEM education and AI-powered learning platforms designed to teach students how to think.**

---

## Overview

**NovaSTEM** is a student-founded STEM education initiative that delivers free, hands-on science and engineering workshops directly to elementary classrooms.

**NovaSTEM EDU** extends this mission through a scalable, AI-powered learning platform focused on **algorithmic thinking** and **scientific reasoning**, using mastery-based progression inspired by platforms like Duolingo.

Together, they form a unified ecosystem combining **in-person impact** with **technology-driven learning at scale**.

## NovaSTEM EDU (AI Learning Platform)

### Vision
Create the **Duolingo of coding and science** — a mastery-based platform that teaches students how to think like computer scientists and scientists, not just memorize facts or syntax.

### Core Pillars

#### 🧠 Coding
A multi-stage progression from foundational thinking to real-world AI development:
- Algorithmic Thinking (no code)
- Problem Decomposition
- Core Programming Concepts
- Software Engineering & APIs
- Machine Learning
- End-to-End AI Application Development

#### 🔬 Science
A reasoning-first approach to scientific thinking:
- Observation
- Cause & Effect
- Systems & Evidence
- Advanced Scientific Inquiry
- Real-World Problem Solving

## Learning Model

Each lesson follows a strict **mastery-based structure**:

1. **Learn**  
   Interactive teaching and conceptual explanation

2. **Practice**  
   Guided reasoning, pseudocode, or short-response challenges

3. **Quiz**  
   Auto-graded mastery check  
   **100% required to advance**

Lessons are locked until mastery is demonstrated.

## NovaCoach (AI Learning Assistant)

NovaSTEM EDU includes **NovaCoach**, a constrained AI learning assistant designed to support thinking without providing answers.

### NovaCoach Rules
- Available **only** during Learn and Practice
- Hidden during quizzes
- Provides:
  - Hints
  - Guiding questions
  - Conceptual explanations
- Never provides:
  - Final answers
  - Code solutions
  - Quiz help

NovaCoach is fully aware of:
- Current pillar and concept
- Lesson stage (Learn / Practice)
- Student input (when allowed)

---

## Concept Contracts

All AI-generated content is governed by **Concept Contracts** — human-authored specifications that define:
- Learning objectives
- Allowed and forbidden tools
- Mastery signals
- Common misconceptions
- AI behavior constraints

This ensures:
- Pedagogical consistency
- Safe AI behavior
- Scalable content generation
- Mastery-focused progression

---

## Technical Architecture (High-Level)

- Static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Lesson engine driven by structured lesson data
- AI-powered content generation and feedback
- Local progress tracking (with future account support)
- Modular, extensible design

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1
- Finalize lesson engine (Learn / Practice / Quiz)
- Implement mastery gating
- Build Algorithmic Thinking pillar end-to-end

### Phase 2
- Integrate NovaCoach AI
- Expand coding and science pillars
- Add progress visualization and streaks

### Phase 3
- Teacher and classroom modes
- Advanced analytics and feedback
- Scalable deployment
